# RandomString
> RandomString utility that allows you to create all possible strings using already created or your own options
> README and documentation writed with translator, but edited for easier understable

## Usage
You can use RandomString in many different ways, the interface allows even a child to understand what to press to get the expected result
but also for more experienced users there is a non-programming language, it is not good but it does its job well, to read the documentation type `help;` in the line for custom config

## Small info
RandomString was done in 3-4 hours
Will be updated for a while, it depends on how quickly I find an idea for another project
