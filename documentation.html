        <div class="Prelude" id="prelude">
            <h2>Prelude</h2>
            <p>(I used translator because im to lazy to write on english by myself)</p>
            <p>This project was done by accident, and by a small idea in an extra class session</p>
            <p>It wasn't really supposed to be anything, but I got too motivated and had to do the documentation</p>
        </div>

        <div class="Syntax" id="syntax">
            <h2>Syntax</h2>
            <p>The syntax is quite understandable and simple, by the way it is similar to the CSS syntax</p>
            <p>To use any statement, you must first enter it, let's say <code>bl_start</code>, then if the statement has values necessary for operation, enter a colon (<code>:</code>), and enter the value itself, in our case any character</p>
            <p>In general, we get the following statement: <code>bl_start: a</code> but to alternate our statements we must also put a semicolon (<code>;</code>)</p>
        </div>

        <div class="Syntax_Sugar" id="syntax_sugar">
            <h2>Syntax Sugar</h2>
            <p>There is not much syntactic sugar here, but it is there, the easiest thing is not needing spaces, i.e. <code>statement:value;</code> and <code>statement : value ;</code> will be the same, use it the way you want</p>
            <p>There is also another advantage, we can list all values for statement in one line without any delimiters</p>
            <p>Personally my favorite way of writing is the same as the basic one in CSS, i.e. <code>statement: value;</code> this is probably the official kind of formatting</p>
        </div>

        <div class="Blacklist" id="blacklist">
            <h2>Blacklist</h2>
            <p>Finally we come to the statements themselves, let's look at the most basic and useful part, the blacklist</p>
            <p>The blacklist is divided into two statements so far, <code>bl_start</code> and <code>bl_end</code>, both of them accept values that we want to forbid, let's consider <code>bl_start</code> first, because their working system is almost the same</p>
            <h3 id="bl_start">bl_start</h3>
            <p><code>bl_start: a;</code> it forbids us to insert the letter a into the string, which gives us full control over the beginning, what letters we want to see at the beginning of our string and what letters we don't want to see</p>
            <p>Yes, that's all, but it gives us a huge advantage for creating some specific strings if used properly</p>
            <h3 id="bl_end">bl_end</h3>
            <p><code>bl_end: a;</code> is actually the same, but as you can see from the statement itself, it forbids using values as the end of a string</p>
            <p>This is actually the magic of the blacklist, to forbid characters in certain places</p>
        </div>

        <div class="Other_Statements" id="other_statements">
            <h2>Other Statements</h2>
            <p>Also, there are some unsorted statements here that may help you in some way when creating strings</p>
            <h3 id="uc_first">uc_first</h3>
            <p><code>uc_first</code> needs no values, so it can simply be used as <code>uc_first;</code></p>
            <p>It makes the first character always in Uppercase, but also note that if you enable Uppercase Characters you probably won't notice any difference</p>
            <h3 id="help">help</h3>
            <p><code>help</code> like <code>uc_first</code> doesn't need a value, so you can just write <code>help;</code></p>
            <p><code>help</code> opens this documentation, in which you can find many discoveries about this site</p>
        </div>

        <div class="Conclusion" id="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Anyway, this documentation was made for the sake of dilution and for the sake of gaining experience for documentation creation, I hope it will be useful to me someday and I hope you enjoyed this documentation</p>
            <p>The more the project lives, the more features you will find here</p>
            <p>I also hope you will visit my <a href="https://github.com/kynlux">github</a></p>
